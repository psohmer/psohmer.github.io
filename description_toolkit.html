<dd>An excellent piece by Eira Tansey on “contemporaneous collecting” of archival materials during major events. She encourages critical thinking regarding pushes to document trauma, pointing out they are often done to appease GLAM administrators and that the people most affected by events (like COVID) are the most unable to participate. An excellent article to return to with some collected thoughts.</dd>
